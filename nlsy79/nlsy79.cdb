This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

This variable corrects inconsistencies in creating the POVSTATUS variable from 
1979 through 1994; this series is now consistent through all years. For archival
purposes, the previous poverty status variables are available for those years 
with the QNAME=POVSTATUS_OLDSTND, although researchers are strongly encouraged 
to use POVSTATUS.

             TOTAL NET FAMILY INCOME IN PAST CALENDAR YEAR *KEY* (TRUNCATED)
 
COMMENT: Total Net Family Income in 2005
NOTE: FOR VARIABLE CREATION, SEE APPENDIX 2: TOTAL NET FAMILY INCOME TRUNCATED 
VALUES ARE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE TOP 2% OF RESPONDENTS WHO ARE U.S. 
RESIDENTS.  IF THE NUMBER OF TRUNCATED VALUES EXCEEDS THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
TRUNCATED AT THE TRADITIONAL TRUNCATION LEVEL OF 100,001 FOR THIS ITEM, VALUES 
OVER THAT TRADITIONAL TRUNCATION LEVEL ARE AVERAGED.  OVERSEAS RESPONDENTS WHOSE
DOLLAR INCOME COULD NOT BE DETERMINED ARE CODED -3.
 
NOTE: WHEREVER POSSIBLE, THIS VARIABLE INCORPORATES THE FOLLOW-UP SELF-REPORTED 
RANGE AND UNFOLDING BRACKET QUESTIONS PRESENT FOR MANY INCOME AMOUNTS TO 
ESTIMATE A VALUE FOR NON-RESPONDERS (THOSE RESPONDING DON'T KNOW OR REFUSE TO 
ACTUAL INCOME AMOUNTS).  THE DECISION RULES FOR FILLING IN INDIVIDUAL MISSING 
INCOME VALUES WITH ESTIMATES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
 
IF SELF-REPORTED RANGES ARE GIVEN AND (EXAMPLE T09126.00, T09128.00):
*UPPER/LOWER VALUES ARE IN PROPER ORDER, MIDPOINT IS USED;
*RANGES ARE GIVEN BACKWARDS, THE VALUES ARE REVERSED AND MIDPOINT IS USED;
*THE SAME VALUE IS GIVEN FOR UPPER/LOWER SELF-REPORTED RANGE VALUE, THAT SINGLE 
VALUE IS USED;
 
IF UNFOLDING BRACKETS ARE ANSWERED (LOW BRACKET < ENTRY VALUE < HIGH BRACKET) 
AND (EXAMPLE T09129.00-T09131.00):
*R REPORTS LESS THAN ENTRY VALUE AND LESS THAN LOW BRACKET, THEN HALF OF LOW 
BRACKET VALUE IS USED (MIDPOINT BETWEEN LOW BRACKET AND 0)
* R REPORTS LESS THAN ENTRY VALUE BUT GREATER THAN LOW BRACKET VALUE, MIDPOINT 
BETWEEN LOW BRACKET AND ENTRY VALUE IS USED;
*R REPORTS GREATER THAN ENTRY VALUE BUT LESS THAN HIGH BRACKET VALUE, MIDPOINT 
BETWEEN ENTRY VALUE AND HIGH BRACKET IS USED;
*R REPORTS GREATER THAN ENTRY VALUE AND GREATER THAN HIGH BRACKET VALUE, THE 
MEAN OF VALID RESPONSES ABOVE THE HIGH BRACKET VALUE IS USED.
